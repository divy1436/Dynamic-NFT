# 🖼️ Dynamic NFT Metadata  

## 📌 Project Description  
Dynamic NFT Metadata is a smart contract implementation that enables NFTs to evolve over time based on real-time events, such as block timestamps. Unlike traditional static NFTs, these NFTs dynamically update their attributes without requiring user input, making them ideal for applications like gaming, collectibles, and time-sensitive digital assets.
